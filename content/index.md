# work in progress

## Quicklinks

* [What Am I Reading](https://dmarx.github.io/papers-feed/) - Live tracker of my (mostly academic) reading habits. How this works: I made a browser extension that logs interactions with content to github, which publishes a frontend over the data as a webapp.
* [Old Blog](https://dmarx.github.io/posts/) - Content will be migrated here in the future, and this site will replace the old blog as my default github landing page.
* [Benchwarmers](https://github.com/dmarx/bench-warmers) - My public brainstorming space. Will almost certainly migrate that here in near future

## todo

- [ ] flesh out basic content
  - [ ] social links
  - [ ] about page
- [ ] non fork repo so i can create issues
- [ ] old blog migration
  - [x] link to old blog
  - [ ] link old blog here
  - [ ] port old blog posts
  - [ ] archive old blog by renaming repo to... I dunno,  `dmarx.github.io.old`
  - [ ] rename this repo to `dmarx.github.io`
- [ ] port benchwarmers
  - open question: should I straight up move the whole system here, or should I set up some sort of ci/cd build process that pushes update from that repo into this one? Could maybe use git-submodules to link repos and automate upgrading to latest commit?
- [ ] port reference vault content
- [ ] create a project highlights page from gh profile
- [ ] art
- [ ] customize graph view
